<p> Hello! If you're reading this, you're probably looking for answers to something. <br>Come on in and have a cup of your preferred beverage. I won't promise answers but I can help you take a break for a moment.

<img src="./assets/hotbeverage.jpg" id="hotbeverage" alt="Please take a seat on the couch. A hot drink is in the mug on the table in front of you. Tea? Coffee? Hot chocolate? Something spirited? There's something here for everyone. The space has a quiet and comfortable atmosphere of a small bookshop...if you were allowed to drink in one.">

<p>Let me introduce myself, I'm called Tildrun. This is my little corner of the internet where I keep writings mostly about my devotional paganism with the eldritch-in-nature Apocrypha. Feel free to browse all my posts by scrolling down or continue on your journey across the internet. You are always welcome back for another drink traveller, no questions asked.

<section> <h2><a id="101 posts">101 posts</a></h2>
<p> This part of the page is your one-stop shop for all the things I learnt when I first started out (or things I wished I could've read)</p>

<article id="noapocalypse"> 
<h3>In Medias Res, or "no, you're not going to cause an apocalypse" </h3>
<p>I'm writing this post in February 2024 and planning on maintaining this site for a long time. This webpage is designed to last.</p>

<p>For some reason you were browsing the internet and my humble page marked with the keywords "paganism, eldritch, witchcraft" (and more) showed up in the results of whichever search engine you use. You're not here for fiction. There is no shortage of articles on eldritch entities in fiction or paganism in all it's flavors. You're probably like me, experiencing or realizing something related to eldritch-in-nature beings and needing to make sense of it..but not finding anything that fits.</p>

<p>And it's terrifying. Both the experience itself and trying to figure it out. Currently social media platforms (especially TikTok) are notorious amongst the witchcraft and pagan communities to freely spread misinformation. Doubly so when it's about scarier aspects of this field or trickster spirits. Let me offer you some reassurance: <strong>Working with eldritch entities is not going to cause an apocalypse.</strong> This page is not one of Absolute Truth (nor is such a thing possible) but being drawn to Them for whatever reason doesn't make you evil or end the world.</p>

<p>You might be asking how I know that you experienced something. Honestly? I don't. There's no twist of fate or something that causes this page to be written specifically for you. I simply wish I had something like this available when I was asking similar questions a year ago. My story told through this page opens <i>In Medias Res</i> â€” in the middle of a scene partway through the story. During this year I haven't learnt a lot, but the little things I did make the Path I am walking feel more solid under my feet.</p>

<p>I don't think working with the Dreadful Ones is ever easy. Especially not in the beginning when you're still figuring everything out. But you are not alone and you have a hot drink on the table.</p>
