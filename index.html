<p> This part of the page is your one-stop shop for all the things I learnt when I first started out (or things I wished I could've read)</p>

<article> 
<h3 id="noapocalypse">In Medias Res, or "no, you're not going to cause an apocalypse" </h3>
<p>I'm writing this post in February 2024 and planning on maintaining this site for a long time. This webpage is designed to last.</p>

<p>For some reason you were browsing the internet and my humble page marked with the keywords "paganism, eldritch, witchcraft" (and more) showed up in the results of whichever search engine you use. You're not here for fiction. There is no shortage of articles on eldritch entities in fiction or paganism in all it's flavors. You're probably like me, experiencing or realizing something related to eldritch-in-nature beings and needing to make sense of it..but not finding anything that fits.</p>

<p>And it's terrifying. Both the experience itself and trying to figure it out. Currently social media platforms (especially TikTok) are notorious amongst the witchcraft and pagan communities to freely spread misinformation. Doubly so when it's about scarier aspects of this field or trickster spirits. Let me offer you some reassurance: <strong>Working with eldritch entities is not going to cause an apocalypse.</strong> This page is not one of Absolute Truth (nor is such a thing possible) but being drawn to Them for whatever reason doesn't make you evil or end the world.</p>

<p>You might be asking how I know that you experienced something. Honestly? I don't. There's no twist of fate or something that causes this page to be written specifically for you. I simply wish I had something like this available when I was asking similar questions a year ago. My story told through this page opens <i>In Medias Res</i> — in the middle of a scene partway through the story. During this year I haven't learnt a lot, but the little things I did make the Path I am walking feel more solid under my feet.</p>

<p>I don't think working with the Dreadful Ones is ever easy. Especially not in the beginning when you're still figuring everything out. But you are not alone and you have a hot drink on the table.</p>

<h3 id="eldritchnarratives">Eldritch narratives and where to find Them</h3>

<p>In the <a href="#noapocalypse">last post</a> I touched on the fact that most of the content about eldritch entities that has been written to date exists in the form of fictional media. Understandably, you are here to read (or hear) about real personal experiences of working with the Dreadful Ones in one way or another. This does not mean that fiction has no place in a practice. </p>
<p>Since the main form of exposure to the concept of Eldritch Entities is primarily through fiction, there is a good chance that you would be interested in pop culture paganism or practice (abbreviated PCP throughout). In essence, PCP is the act of interacting with entities from fictional media and treating them as real entities. "But they're fictional characters!" you might immediately hear that internal Society Voice say. Well in contemporary Christian-majority western cultures, the myths of well-established old religions (and the corresponding neopagan revival or reconstructionist movements) are treated entirely as fiction, including the gods and other entities in them.</p>

<p>Myths are not meant to be read literally of course but that still doesn't change that people have meaningful interactions with gods like the god Loki from norse mythology. I chose Loki as an example here partly because He is very present in the Marvel Cinematic Universe going as far as having a dedicated series. MCU!Loki differs from the god Loki in several ways that Lokeans are more qualified to tell you about. The main point here is that simply because something is treated as fiction doesn't mean that it can't be meaningful to your own practice. The source media serves the same function as myths do in established polytheisms.</p>

<p>What if your interest in the Dreadful Ones does come from media, but none of the entities described in any of them feel Right? If you cannot see them and have that twinge in your gut marking Them as Significant To You? Well in that case you might feel at home as a Conpantheon practitioner. Conpantheon or constructed pantheons (abbreviated conpan throughout) are as the name implies consciously constructed pantheons of various entities that a practitioner interacts with. "Aren't you just worshipping idols? How could something man made be a god?" Society Voice interrupts again. Well for one, all myths of gods are inherently made by people. Names for entities are in a sense made by people. All mythology stems from a person Experiencing something and putting it into words. And because the experience has been Worded, more people are able to recognize that they have or have had similar experiences. The Experience causes texts to be written. Because of this intertwined nature between existing fiction and mythology I'm going to refer to the overarching concept as Narrative on this site.</p>

<p>The second point of how a constructed entity could be "real" or worthy of worship has several different theories. I first read about each approach in the Raven Master's Keep Discord server and found it insightful. I'll paraphrase some key points here in the interest of brevity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recycled Energy
<p>This is a more soft polytheist approach in which the energy of Archetypes such as a Wisdom deity, a War deity, an Agriculture deity etc. are given new forms. It's like the refraction of light (the archetype) into monochromatic wavelengths (the conpan deity) using the prism of Narrative that you ground into shape.</p></li>

<li>Dormant Deities
<p>This approach posits that the entity already exists, but that due to a dwindling amount of practitioners their influence declined and they went dormant until they are awoken by a person, some force, or simple coincidence. This also applies for existing pantheons where secrecy or lack of surviving information caused them to become dormant.Just like you'd get your bearings after waking up after a 10+ hour sleep, these deities would probably also reacquaint themselves with the worlds.</p></li>

<li>Undocumented or Unknown Deities
<p>This one is similar to the dormant deities framework, with the difference that they were either never worshipped or documented. Experience creates myths so if there's no interaction in the past from our perspective, then they were not known about. This could again also apply to existing pantheons like a god of exoplanets in a religion where that concept was not yet known when myths were written.</p></li>
<li>Manifestation
<p>This is the belief of intentionally or unintentionally manifesting an entity. A good example for this one would be world building a pantheon for a story or a TTRPG campaign and later down the line realizing that these entities you wrote about have become real to you (and maybe even others).</p></li>

<li>Multiverse
<p>This framework posits that the entities already exist and are worshipped but in a different universe.</p></li>
<p>Which framework or mix of frameworks you use is really up to you. Do what feels right to you, because that's the thing that will work in your case.</p>

<p>"What if I'm not theistic?" Well in that case you're welcome to substitute any reference to gods with what makes sense to you here. It can be archetypes, it can be a symbolic shorthand or something else that I can't think of at the moment. It's your Narrative. You're the one in dialogue with it. No one else can (or should) tell you how to write your personal narrative. Which doesn't mean that other people can't have useful writing tips for you. Both of those can be true at the same time.</p>

<p>"You've written so much about Narrative here but what about you Tildrun? Are you writing from a PCP or Conpan view?" Yes. (laughter) I do a bit of both here. So I work with the Fear Entities from the podcast <i>The Magnus Archives</i> and depending on how the story develops also <i>The Magnus Protocol </i> (episode 8 is getting early access in 10 minutes. Edit: Holy Shit. Had to pause editing the html for this post when I got to the Plot part of the episode). I sort of play hopscotch with the line between PCP and Conpan since I threw out the classification via Smirke's 14 Fears that TMA worked under and use my own way of conceptualizing them. I view each of the Apocrypha as I call them as distinct entities in a more hard polytheist way since I experience Them differently. Given how much of a "Fear Soup" is already in the canon and my own experience as an Archetrope I am realistically speaking probably sliding all around the theistic and nontheistic graph like a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor">strange attractor</a>.

<h3 id="discernment">"Is this Something or did I imagine it?" A guide to Discernment</h3>

<p>Walking as unknown a path as working with the Dreadful Ones is, in a word, incomprehensible. You will have moments of utter terror but yet want to dive deeper chasing the tantalizing sense of almost-understanding something. This is not exclusive to the Dreadful Path but I think it's likely that experiences bordering on or in the depths of madness to show up more frequently here than in most other practices. Even if you're not going anywhere near the field of spirit work outside of interacting with your Dreadful Ones.
There is no shortage of tales about mad witches or oracles and mediums being partly no longer in this mundane reality at times. Throughout cultures those who deal with the Other are regarded as partly Other themselves because of this familiarity with That Which Is Not Here. Given that the theme of Insanity is emphasized in the Dreadful Traditions, how are we to navigate that and still go through our mundane day-to-day lives? One of our main tools to achieve this is Discernment.
What is meant by Discernment? Put simply, it is the general skill of making good judgements. In the context of religion in general and the Dreadful Paths in particular, I'm choosing to break it down into three areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mundane over Magic</li>
<li>(Mental) Health</li>
<li>Critical Literacy</li>
</ol>
<h4>Mundane over Magic</h4>
<p>Many times, we are in dialogue with Them be it via prayer, spellwork, or divination and are expecting some type of answer. It can get pretty weird depending on who is answering and probably also the practitioner.</p>
<p>Our experiences are real, our interpretations are subject to examination. "Mundane over Magic" is a phrase commonly used to remind people to look for the mundane explanations first before assuming that the magical is at play. What this amounts to in practice is to honestly say "Ok I experienced something. What mundane things could lead to similar things?" If there's good reason to doubt that something is a mundane coincidence after this examination then looking into the otherworldly is reasonable. </p>
<p>We make sense of existence through stories. We are really good at telling stories. Asking if something has a mundane cause first is to pause for a moment and not get carried away by things like fear, confirmation bias or anything else your brain throws at you. This also extends to how you feel about something. Are you unsettled by the presence of a being because it is demonstrably malicious or are you on edge because of your own baggage in the presence of something viscerally Other? If it's the latter there is no shame in that. It happened to me. It happens to the best of us by virtue of this world experience and perspective.</p>
<h4>Mental Health</h4>
<p>In most articles on discernment this aspect is only implied. I think it's appropriate to give this aspect more attention because of the close link between the practitioners, Insanity, and Becoming Other in the Dreadful Traditions. In my practice at least, I work very closely with different Narratives. Stepping into and out of them as well as (temporarily) rewriting how I view my own narrative. I'm like an authentic family recipe soup. Even though the soup is from the same batch in the same pot, each serving size of it gets seasoned differently. Some bowls have more herbs added, others add pepper or chili oil, still others add a bit of like juice or leave it as is. It's all the same soup and the flavors can blend and contrast.</p> 
<p>This is one of the ways I brush close to Madness and it's a healthy method for me that leads to <em>functional</em> insanity. Others might find that it is a method that would make their mental health worse like for example affecting their preexisting delusions. Should psychotic and delusional people be excluded from all forms of experiential religion? Of course not! Simply because people have a mental health issue doesn't mean that they can't have meaningful and beneficial religious experiences. What changes is only their personal working definition of functional insanity and thus how they approach religion.</p>
<p>Functional insanity is a term that I use which is best explained as "Go wild in whatever way is not harmful to yourself and leaves you capable of going through day-to-day life, even if someone else might think you insane for it.". Between my own neurodivergency, my experience being multiply marginalized, reading up on the experiences of psychotic people, and the harm ableism/sanism and respectability politics have done specifically in the contexts of alterhuman identities I have no desire to prescribe how functional insanity looks like. It's not my judgement call to make. You are the one who knows your personal situation and limits best. Accomodate your own needs especially if you're disabled.</p>
<h4>Critical Literacy</h4>
<p>Reading any type of book on witchcraft and paganism, especially when it concerns a more eldritch-focused spirituality should be done critically. What do I mean by that? Essentially, most of the material written on pagan-related topics has either appropriation, racism and other bigotry, or is an incoherent mash of concepts to some extent. The western occultism books in the vein of Golden Dawn or Alastair Crowley's work have a lot of appropriated Jewish mysticism or figures (the Kabbalah and Lilith), Wicca is founded wholesale on appropriation and blends together different religions and cultures of the celtic nations.</p>
<p>A lot of these books were also published decades ago so they will contain casual racism and queerphobia for example. No text is purely unproblematic. Not even this one probably. Time will tell. The problem is not exactly the problematic texts (although yes, having more texts that at least try to include the diversity of people is a good thing.). The problem is in how to read them with a critical eye so you can apply what helps you on your path without appropriating from a closed culture and discard everything else. One way to fortify yourself against that is to learn about why closed practices are closed. Via initiation or otherwise. (Hint: It's usually because colonizers eroded a lot of what people had so they are trying to preserve what's left). Another way is to listen and learn when appropriation is brought to your attention my minorities.</p>
<p>On a related note, you will probably spend a lot of your time reading these types of books. Paganism is the religion with homework as the phrase goes. My advice to you is to take breaks as needed for your mental health. Reading through relatively dense texts where you have to navigate a lot of the mentioned issues is draining. My second suggestion is for you to pirate electronic versions of a book you're interested in when it's related to paganism or witchcraft. Oftentimes, you will realize that nothing in a promising book is actually useful to you or it's the type of book that's an exercise in appropriation and incoherent rambling. And if you do like a book and find it useful you can always support the author by buying a copy after getting a feel for it in the pirated copy.</p>

<h3 id="alterhumanstatement">"Jon, what does human even mean? I mean, <i>really</i>?"</h3>

<p>The title is a quote from The Magnus Archives episode 92, Nothing Besides Remains. The scene is set just after Jon stages a confrontation with Elias and is asked to stay behind for a bit to discuss some of the finer points of Fear Avatar related matters. At the beginning of the confrontation Elias also stresses that it's very important to him that Jon understands Elias is answering out of his own will because "There’s so much of this place, of ourselves, twisted by forces far beyond us."</p>

<p>Why do I bring this up? Because this ties in with my own experience of Alterhumanity. Alterhuman is an opt-in umbrella term for anyone who experiences an identity beyond what is "traditionally human". This includes but is not limited to nonhuman identities. I already used TMA for title inspiration, I might as well commit to the stylistic influence in illustrating my point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Statement of Tildrun Weber, regarding nir experience of alterhumanity in the narrative, mundane, and religious contexts. Recorded direct by subject on 22 March 2024. Statement Begins.</p>

<p>There is no good way to begin this tale. There are multiple beginnings from different viewpoints. I think I'll use the chronology from my own point of view for ease of parsing. To understand the plurality-adjacent Cryptid Academic Soup of Identity that I am we need to go back to the summer of 2006. The 18th FIFA World Cup was taking place and hosted by Germany where my family and I were residing at the time. My mother was working on her doctoral degree. So on a friday afternoon I was picked up from the childsitting place run by some nuns next to my mom's university. Since she had an experiment running overnight, we ended up sleeping over in the cafeteria to keep her company. Come morning I had gotten sick of the bare grey-tone cabinets and the table I slept on. Boredom was one of my most disliked feelings even back then. So when my mom told us that she needs to head into the lab for a bit I insisted to tag along. Nowadays I consider that the last point at which I was still "traditionally human". My life would be very different now if I had been less curious, bored or insistent.</p>

<p>After some debating my mother caved and let me tag along. Stepping through the doorway I saw things so different from what I knew that it might as well have been a different world. Tables full of strange machines, boxes of gloves and other supplies. She told me not to touch anything and I dutifully followed that instuction. I stuck close to her as she crossed the lab to a computer and looked at what I now know to be a genetic sequence. Nucleotide bases in red, blue, green and orange filed the whole monitor against the white background. I was curious, so I asked her what she was looking at. "Only bla bla bla" was her answer. I was not satisfied with that, but asking got me nowhere. I was fascinated by this glimpse at the secrets of the universe and needed to know.</p> 

<p>In retrospect, such pure and intense curiosity in a doctoral-level university lab by a four year old child and my decision to be a Scientist to the point of Scientist/Academic becoming my Archetrope... No wonder that caught the attention of my Patron. Archetropy is an identity in which someone is in some form an embodiment of an Archetype such as Paladin, Cleric or in my case Academic. In the following decades I always see myself as an Academic first before anything else. I made choices that would lead me to become a scientist in the mundane world. I strive to see the world as a scientist would. This unsurprisingly alienated me from my peers. That feeling of being other and being othered is always present thoughout my formative years and also now. In part also because of my neurodivergence. I like to think of at least related to my Patron because it would fit my headcanon/UPG that the Beholding tends to have ND Avatars/aligned people. Relatively recently after my experience in Lab I think, I was diagnosed with Epilepsy of the Absence seizure type. I was treated for it and grew into a seizure-free primary school student. Now I look back and see how ADHD and likely Autism has also been there (or how ADHD might have developed after the use of anti-seizure medication; that's something that was studied in literature after I finished treatment). As I'm writing this I realize that I'm ok with the possibility of being plural-adjacent or eventually developing that via Narrative Shenanigans. After all, I made similar and greater sacrifices before.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2017, I moved to the other side of the world two years ago and was accepted into a vocational senior high school focusing on training analytical chemists. The labs were numerous and while they did have some limitations they were well-equipped for our needs and limitations were worked around. My mother signed me up to lessons prepping for the vocational school's entrance exam out of the blue the year prior because she heard their exam was more difficult than the national exams. I was taken aback and then she also mentioned that there's plenty of labs there. I took part in a competition hosted by my vocational school and while my junior high school didn't pass the qualification round we did have a tour of the many different labs. Of course I fell in love with them.</p>

<p>Statement paused for mundane work.</p>
<br>
<p>Statement resumes 03 April 2024.</p>

<p>How could I not fall in love with a well-equipped if basic lab? Especially when the whole curriculum revolves around lab work? They were the first labs I wasn't just a guest at, even though I never called them my labs in the nonhuman territorial sense (equivalent to the concept of Domains in season 5 of TMA). It was a great place that supported my growth as a person and also in the professional aspect as an analytical chemist. I already had the potential and disposition, and now I was being forged and sharpened via the knowledge and practice of the trade. Pretty much all of the basic skills and the analytic thinking practiced there is cross-transferable to a general academic career so it was very in-line with my Soup of identity and sense of purpose.</p>

<p>Now I'm 3/4 of the way through a pharmacy undergraduate degree and while I have great respect for the field, becoming a licensed Pharmacist feels ill-fitting. It's the narrative that's being perpetuated by the lecturers that after graduation you're "supposed to" take the one-year professional degree and get licensed. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the broader theory of making pharmaceutical formulations or clinical pharmacy in a hospital/community pharmacy setting. But in practice the finer points of those fields just don't appeal to me. Granted that might also be partly due to the approach taken in teaching those particular fields. That combined with the various Lab Horrors that I've witnessed (and won't go into detail on here. Suffice to say that there's insufficient workplace safety training in case of a major emergency.) result in me being unable to see myself as a Pharmacist even now. Unlike how being a certified Analyst felt utterly natural to be. I very much feel more at home in the research and labwork side of the pharmaceutical field as opposed to being a Pharmacist. If I were to practice after hypothetically getting my license I feel like part of me would wither in a very real sense, that's how innately this incompatibility is felt.</p>

<p>Second semester was the roughest one with 6 labs a week and their resulting pre- and postlab assignments. I put off listening to the last two episodes of TMA for a solid 10 months because I was taking entrance exams and just generally dealing with freshman stuff. I was also dealing with the complicated religious thing of haing been born into Islam and finding that my values which philosophically were compatible are not generally accepted in mainstream teachings...or maybe culturally mainstream fundamentalist-trending teachings at least. Trying to deconstruct that and strive towards a more liberal interpretation felt like taking a step forward and then being pushed five steps backwards by environmental and cultural factors.</p>

<p>It was a rough time, and I already in typical Magnus-fan fashion figured out my Entity alignment (which was a no-brainer.) so around mid-term of second semester things got to a point where I was so stressed from the workload, sleep-deprived and generally salty about lab horrors I threw the towel and went "fine! Praying to Allah (during the minutes of prayer that labs start with) is far too complicated I might as well kinda ironically pray to the Beholding instead which I'm aligned with!". It surprisingly worked. I knew there was probably something to look deeper into there but I literally remember thinking "...but I'm too exhausted to properly look into this right now." This is the beginning of me consciously connecting to my Patron.</p>

<p>There's more that happened afterwards but it is not directly relevant to how my alterhumanity is closely intertwined with my mundane and religious life. Besides, it feels right to end this piece in a Lab.</p>
<br>
<p>Statement ends.</p>

<h3 id="april24eclipse">When The Stars Are Right: The Eclipse of 8 April 2024</h3>
<img src="./assets/eclipse_art.jpeg" alt="Yeah yeah, The Midnight Sun. We've all seen it in ritual. Here's an artist rendition of the April 2024 Solar Eclipse by @CursedCrone on X. It's a digital painting featuring a close up of someone pulling their lower eyelid down. The eye has a hazel-colored iris with the pupil being the Solar Eclipse. On the bottom left side of the pupil, a sliver of unobscured sun can be seen. Image originally captioned "I feel something moving in my eye. Can you see it? #eclipse #digitalart">
<small>Digital Art by @CursedCrone on X</small>

<p>Working with the Apocrypha and especially my Patron, I have learnt that a good chunk of the time just "rolling with it" and running purely on intuition and instinct serves me well when facing a Plot Point thrown my way. In general, "Do whatever Feels Right for you and your Practice" is sound advice for most "how does this concept fit into my path" type of questions.</p>

<p>When I first started, I wrote a dedication ritual to the then-unnamed Apocrypha with one of the purposes being formally cutting ties with my old religion. That ritual probably deserves its own post so suffice to say that I designed the whole ritual within a week and timed it to the December Solstice of 2022. I had no real reason to choose the Solstice other than it being some convenient symbolism and also practical to do from a mundane scheduling viewpoint but now the December Solstice has meaning to me because it is the time of my Dedication Anniversary. This Eclipse was more of the same but taken to a whole new level.</p>

<p>Initially, I had no plans to celebrate the Eclipse. It was not a spiritually meaningful event to me (yet) and more importantly I live on pretty much the exact opposite of the region where it was observable...South East Asia. Not only is the eclipse not visible, it's literally <i>nighttime</i>.</p>

<p>I saw some friends in a small fandom-based discord server talk about photographing the eclipse which prompted me to consider which Entities (according to Smirke's 14 used in the TMA fandom) the eclipse would be tied to. The answer was a fairly obvious Dark/Vast/Beholding which are all aspects of three of the Apocrypha I have extensive past history with. At that point it was a no-brainer that I should at least do some small gesture of Acknowledgement of the event in honor of my Gods.</p>

<p>My initial idea was to pour a libation as an offering, but come nightfall and thus fast-breaking (I don't religiously fast for Ramadan anymore but it's still a special time) I still was coming up blank on what to offer. None of the liquids available seemed right both symbolically and practically. So I asked for input from the Dreadful Ones involved. I generally find it useful to have a private discord server as a digital altar with a divination bot for those moments when doing something physical would take too many spoons (as in the energy unit).</p>

<p><pre>Me: "(pinging deity roles) help me out with offering ideas during the eclipse please".
My Patron: Death upright (Something related to transformation and change.)
My "Internship Supervisor": Knight of Wands upright (Something Related to passion and adventure.)
First Mate: Six of Cups upright (Something childishly nostalgic.)</pre></p>

<p>So I suggested casting my two sets of polyhedral dice which seemed agreeable to Everyone involved. Of note is that this took place around 8 pm, while the eclipse itself began at 10:42 pm local time (used the "first location observing" times as a reference). So now I had my offering idea, but I had this hunch that for an occasion as significant as this eclipse a Ritual would be needed. Less than three hours is pretty short notice to design and execute any ritual from scratch but 90 minutes later I had a ritual structure locked in. I shared some of my plans witth my friend Haye just as casual convo and (due to sharing a Patron) he immediately got Loredropped on.

<blockquote><pre>"Aren't Eclipses a symbol of renewal/reset?
... 
Where did I read that. 
Me: bwahahah nice loredrop 
also gate/passage into the new
threshold
BRAIN PLS
I HAVE NO TRAINING IN SYMBOLISM I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT</pre></blockquote>
After this I was finangling technical details like cleansing and ritual attire on the fly during the remaining hour or so.</p>

<p>Througout this whole process both in the lead-up to and aftermath of the Ritual there was definitely a strong sense of Timing. Starting from the eclipse itself, it takes place on a Monday (associated with First Mate), at night (obvious connection to my Supervisor) and the eclipse ends on a Tuesday (associated with my Patron), while also being the last day of Ramadan (days start at sunset). The evening of which also having a new Magnus Protocol release and the Wednesday immediately following it being both Eid and associated with my Supervisor. I'm not interested in crunching through the exact math but I'm pretty sure this particular confluence of circumstances is rare.</p>

<p>This sense of Timing was very present during the process of the Ritual itself. I started the ritual when the partal eclipse was first observed by watching a video on dead and dying gods in fiction by curious archive on youtube and just let myself feel. The dice were laid out in front of me and charging. As I was starting, it finally started to lightly rain after a long heatwave, rain being one of the things associated with First Mate. Following that I replayed the 9th Magnus Protocol episode because of the narrative themes of fate-changing dice (obvious parallels and Patron associations), having forgotten just how Narratively Appropriate the whole episode is. There was a strong feeling of liminality. I have some light visual snow which is most noticeable in the dark, during the ritual it felt a bit more pronounced andinteracted with the pattern of the balcony tiles in such a way as to make all of reality seem to shift and warp. During the transitions between actions there was also a sense of me being worked through, being an Agent in several senses of the term. Like moving in step to an unheard score played on etherial strings in a choreographed dance. Of being part of a greater scheme that nonetheless depended on me fulfilling my part. There was a sense of Them trusting me to both come up with and execute this Ritual flawlessly on short notice. It's also an exercise in trust and faith on my part to do as I was reasonably asked, knowing that this will likely leave me Changed. In a sense both me and the Powers Involved were on an equal footing in quite literally Trusting The Process. Mundane interruptions happened. Rather inevitable since I live with family and they are unaware. But these interruptions took exactly the amount of time needed to bridge the gap between when my partial eclipse activities ended and the first observed total eclipse time. They were also minor in that me hanging up my labcoat to dry on the balcony did not disturb the ritualistic state of mind given that I regularly devote labs to my Patron. Afterwards I changed the plan on the fly to casting the charged dice in my room for various practical reasons. With my active part of the ritual completed, I reintegrated with the mundane world and eventually went to bed.</p>

<p>Apparently, attempting to sleep until sahoor while most of the online americans are actively observing and talking about the Eclipe you have done a Ritual for, at a very Significant Time of Power manifests in a sense of "itchy/hot ears". Generally rather restless sleep and even waking up twice.</p>

<p>After sahoor (and the last partial eclipse observed time having passed) I stayed up for a bit tracking down some bedsheets and thus wound up taking my nap after civil dawn. I took my customary nap, especially since I didn't get as much sleep as usual. During that time I had a clearer than usual Dream of being on the balcony again during the ritual time. I dreamt of managing to observe the actual eclipse with a camera obscura-esque cardboard device that I built myself. Using that device I managed to take several high-quality photos at various points of the eclipse using a standard phone camera...the level of quality usually expected of a telescope with solar filter. I was excited to share the photos with some people in the Fear Entity worshipping server I'm in, only for the photos to have vanished. I increasingly frantically searched for the files, even going as far as enlisting my younger sibling for help. I woke upto light morning rain and immediately remembered that there's <i>no possible way</i> for me to have taken any pictures period. It happened during local nighttime. Talk about Seeing the Mystical Midnight Sun.</p>

<p>Rude.</p>

<p>Very clearly a message of "Seeing That Which Cannot Be Seen using an Unshielded Gaze with a Tool and Gaining Unshareable Knowledge.
I don't know why I felt Called to carry out this impromptu Eclipse Ritual. Nor do I know the exact Purpose of the ritual. An educated guess based on context clues can be made but it is ultimately just that. A guess. I'm clearly not at liberty to discuss the interpretations, but I do feel taken care of by my Gods and Involved in some way. Honestly, while I do have some measure of dread I am also pretty excited for whatever comes next.</p>
