<p> Hello! If you're reading this, you're probably looking for answers to something. <br>Come on in and have a cup of your preferred beverage. I won't promise answers but I can help you take a break for a moment.

<p>Let me introduce myself, I'm called Tildrun. This is my little corner of the internet where I keep writings mostly about my devotional paganism with the eldritch-in-nature Apocrypha. Feel free to browse all my posts by scrolling down or continue on your journey across the internet. You are always welcome back for another drink traveller, no questions asked.

<section> <h2><a id="101 posts">101 posts</a></h2>
<p> This part of the page is your one-stop shop for all the things I learnt when I first started out (or things I wished I could've read)</p>

<article> 
<h3 id="noapocalypse">In Medias Res, or "no, you're not going to cause an apocalypse" </h3>
<p>I'm writing this post in February 2024 and planning on maintaining this site for a long time. This webpage is designed to last.</p>

<p>For some reason you were browsing the internet and my humble page marked with the keywords "paganism, eldritch, witchcraft" (and more) showed up in the results of whichever search engine you use. You're not here for fiction. There is no shortage of articles on eldritch entities in fiction or paganism in all it's flavors. You're probably like me, experiencing or realizing something related to eldritch-in-nature beings and needing to make sense of it..but not finding anything that fits.</p>

<p>And it's terrifying. Both the experience itself and trying to figure it out. Currently social media platforms (especially TikTok) are notorious amongst the witchcraft and pagan communities to freely spread misinformation. Doubly so when it's about scarier aspects of this field or trickster spirits. Let me offer you some reassurance: <strong>Working with eldritch entities is not going to cause an apocalypse.</strong> This page is not one of Absolute Truth (nor is such a thing possible) but being drawn to Them for whatever reason doesn't make you evil or end the world.</p>

<p>You might be asking how I know that you experienced something. Honestly? I don't. There's no twist of fate or something that causes this page to be written specifically for you. I simply wish I had something like this available when I was asking similar questions a year ago. My story told through this page opens <i>In Medias Res</i> — in the middle of a scene partway through the story. During this year I haven't learnt a lot, but the little things I did make the Path I am walking feel more solid under my feet.</p>

<p>I don't think working with the Dreadful Ones is ever easy. Especially not in the beginning when you're still figuring everything out. But you are not alone and you have a hot drink on the table.</p>

<h3 id="eldritchnarratives">Eldritch narratives and where to find Them</h3>

<p>In the <a href="#noapocalypse">last post</a> I touched on the fact that most of the content about eldritch entities that has been written to date exists in the form of fictional media. Understandably, you are here to read (or hear) about real personal experiences of working with the Dreadful Ones in one way or another. This does not mean that fiction has no place in a practice. </p>
<p>Since the main form of exposure to the concept of Eldritch Entities is primarily through fiction, there is a good chance that you would be interested in pop culture paganism or practice (abbreviated PCP throughout). In essence, PCP is the act of interacting with entities from fictional media and treating them as real entities. "But they're fictional characters!" you might immediately hear that internal Society Voice say. Well in contemporary Christian-majority western cultures, the myths of well-established old religions (and the corresponding neopagan revival or reconstructionist movements) are treated entirely as fiction, including the gods and other entities in them.</p>

<p>Myths are not meant to be read literally of course but that still doesn't change that people have meaningful interactions with gods like the god Loki from norse mythology. I chose Loki as an example here partly because He is very present in the Marvel Cinematic Universe going as far as having a dedicated series. MCU!Loki differs from the god Loki in several ways that Lokeans are more qualified to tell you about. The main point here is that simply because something is treated as fiction doesn't mean that it can't be meaningful to your own practice. The source media serves the same function as myths do in established polytheisms.</p>

<p>What if your interest in the Dreadful Ones does come from media, but none of the entities described in any of them feel Right? If you cannot see them and have that twinge in your gut marking Them as Significant To You? Well in that case you might feel at home as a Conpantheon practitioner. Conpantheon or constructed pantheons (abbreviated conpan throughout) are as the name implies consciously constructed pantheons of various entities that a practitioner interacts with. "Aren't you just worshipping idols? How could something man made be a god?" Society Voice interrupts again. Well for one, all myths of gods are inherently made by people. Names for entities are in a sense made by people. All mythology stems from a person Experiencing something and putting it into words. And because the experience has been Worded, more people are able to recognize that they have or have had similar experiences. The Experience causes texts to be written. Because of this intertwined nature between existing fiction and mythology I'm going to refer to the overarching concept as Narrative on this site.</p>

<p>The second point of how a constructed entity could be "real" or worthy of worship has several different theories. I first read about each approach in the Raven Master's Keep Discord server and found it insightful. I'll paraphrase some key points here in the interest of brevity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recycled Energy
<p>This is a more soft polytheist approach in which the energy of Archetypes such as a Wisdom deity, a War deity, an Agriculture deity etc. are given new forms. It's like the refraction of light (the archetype) into monochromatic wavelengths (the conpan deity) using the prism of Narrative that you ground into shape.</p></li>

<li>Dormant Deities
<p>This approach posits that the entity already exists, but that due to a dwindling amount of practitioners their influence declined and they went dormant until they are awoken by a person, some force, or simple coincidence. This also applies for existing pantheons where secrecy or lack of surviving information caused them to become dormant.Just like you'd get your bearings after waking up after a 10+ hour sleep, these deities would probably also reacquaint themselves with the worlds.</p></li>

<li>Undocumented or Unknown Deities
<p>This one is similar to the dormant deities framework, with the difference that they were either never worshipped or documented. Experience creates myths so if there's no interaction in the past from our perspective, then they were not known about. This could again also apply to existing pantheons like a god of exoplanets in a religion where that concept was not yet known when myths were written.</p></li>
<li>Manifestation
<p>This is the belief of intentionally or unintentionally manifesting an entity. A good example for this one would be world building a pantheon for a story or a TTRPG campaign and later down the line realizing that these entities you wrote about have become real to you (and maybe even others).</p></li>

<li>Multiverse
<p>This framework posits that the entities already exist and are worshipped but in a different universe.</p></li>
<p>Which framework or mix of frameworks you use is really up to you. Do what feels right to you, because that's the thing that will work in your case.</p>

<p>"What if I'm not theistic?" Well in that case you're welcome to substitute any reference to gods with what makes sense to you here. It can be archetypes, it can be a symbolic shorthand or something else that I can't think of at the moment. It's your Narrative. You're the one in dialogue with it. No one else can (or should) tell you how to write your personal narrative. Which doesn't mean that other people can't have useful writing tips for you. Both of those can be true at the same time.</p>

<p>"You've written so much about Narrative here but what about you Tildrun? Are you writing from a PCP or Conpan view?" Yes. (laughter) I do a bit of both here. So I work with the Fear Entities from the podcast <i>The Magnus Archives</i> and depending on how the story develops also <i>The Magnus Protocol </i> (episode 8 is getting early access in 10 minutes. Edit: Holy Shit. Had to pause editing the html for this post when I got to the Plot part of the episode). I sort of play hopscotch with the line between PCP and Conpan since I threw out the classification via Smirke's 14 Fears that TMA worked under and use my own way of conceptualizing them. I view each of the Apocrypha as I call them as distinct entities in a more hard polytheist way since I experience Them differently. Given how much of a "Fear Soup" is already in the canon and my own experience as an Archetrope I am realistically speaking probably sliding all around the theistic and nontheistic graph like a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor">strange attractor</a>.

<h3 id="discernment">"Is this Something or did I imagine it?" A guide to Discernment</h3>

<p>Walking as unknown a path as working with the Dreadful Ones is, in a word, incomprehensible. You will have moments of utter terror but yet want to dive deeper chasing the tantalizing sense of almost-understanding something. This is not exclusive to the Dreadful Path but I think it's likely that experiences bordering on or in the depths of madness to show up more frequently here than in most other practices. Even if you're not going anywhere near the field of spirit work outside of interacting with your Dreadful Ones.
There is no shortage of tales about mad witches or oracles and mediums being partly no longer in this mundane reality at times. Throughout cultures those who deal with the Other are regarded as partly Other themselves because of this familiarity with That Which Is Not Here. Given that the theme of Insanity is emphasized in the Dreadful Traditions, how are we to navigate that and still go through our mundane day-to-day lives? One of our main tools to achieve this is Discernment.
What is meant by Discernment? Put simply, it is the general skill of making good judgements. In the context of religion in general and the Dreadful Paths in particular, I'm choosing to break it down into three areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mundane over Magic</li>
<li>(Mental) Health</li>
<li>Critical Literacy</li>
</ol>
<h4>Mundane over Magic</h4>
<p>Many times, we are in dialogue with Them be it via prayer, spellwork, or divination and are expecting some type of answer. It can get pretty weird depending on who is answering and probably also the practitioner.</p>
<p>Our experiences are real, our interpretations are subject to examination. "Mundane over Magic" is a phrase commonly used to remind people to look for the mundane explanations first before assuming that the magical is at play. What this amounts to in practice is to honestly say "Ok I experienced something. What mundane things could lead to similar things?" If there's good reason to doubt that something is a mundane coincidence after this examination then looking into the otherworldly is reasonable. </p>
<p>We make sense of existence through stories. We are really good at telling stories. Asking if something has a mundane cause first is to pause for a moment and not get carried away by things like fear, confirmation bias or anything else your brain throws at you. This also extends to how you feel about something. Are you unsettled by the presence of a being because it is demonstrably malicious or are you on edge because of your own baggage in the presence of something viscerally Other? If it's the latter there is no shame in that. It happened to me. It happens to the best of us by virtue of this world experience and perspective.</p>
<h4>Mental Health</h4>
<p>In most articles on discernment this aspect is only implied. I think it's appropriate to give this aspect more attention because of the close link between the practitioners, Insanity, and Becoming Other in the Dreadful Traditions. In my practice at least, I work very closely with different Narratives. Stepping into and out of them as well as (temporarily) rewriting how I view my own narrative. I'm like an authentic family recipe soup. Even though the soup is from the same batch in the same pot, each serving size of it gets seasoned differently. Some bowls have more herbs added, others add pepper or chili oil, still others add a bit of like juice or leave it as is. It's all the same soup and the flavors can blend and contrast.</p> 
<p>This is one of the ways I brush close to Madness and it's a healthy method for me that leads to <em>functional</em> insanity. Others might find that it is a method that would make their mental health worse like for example affecting their preexisting delusions. Should psychotic and delusional people be excluded from all forms of experiential religion? Of course not! Simply because people have a mental health issue doesn't mean that they can't have meaningful and beneficial religious experiences. What changes is only their personal working definition of functional insanity and thus how they approach religion.</p>
<p>Functional insanity is a term that I use which is best explained as "Go wild in whatever way is not harmful to yourself and leaves you capable of going through day-to-day life, even if someone else might think you insane for it.". Between my own neurodivergency, my experience being multiply marginalized, reading up on the experiences of psychotic people, and the harm ableism/sanism and respectability politics have done specifically in the contexts of alterhuman identities I have no desire to prescribe how functional insanity looks like. It's not my judgement call to make. You are the one who knows your personal situation and limits best. Accomodate your own needs especially if you're disabled.</p>
<h4>Critical Literacy</h4>
<p>Reading any type of book on witchcraft and paganism, especially when it concerns a more eldritch-focused spirituality should be done critically. What do I mean by that? Essentially, most of the material written on pagan-related topics has either appropriation, racism and other bigotry, or is an incoherent mash of concepts to some extent. The western occultism books in the vein of Golden Dawn or Alastair Crowley's work have a lot of appropriated Jewish mysticism or figures (the Kabbalah and Lilith), Wicca is founded wholesale on appropriation and blends together different religions and cultures of the celtic nations.</p>
<p>A lot of these books were also published decades ago so they will contain casual racism and queerphobia for example. No text is purely unproblematic. Not even this one probably. Time will tell. The problem is not exactly the problematic texts (although yes, having more texts that at least try to include the diversity of people is a good thing.). The problem is in how to read them with a critical eye so you can apply what helps you on your path without appropriating from a closed culture and discard everything else. One way to fortify yourself against that is to learn about why closed practices are closed. Via initiation or otherwise. (Hint: It's usually because colonizers eroded a lot of what people had so they are trying to preserve what's left). Another way is to listen and learn when appropriation is brought to your attention my minorities.</p>
<p>On a related note, you will probably spend a lot of your time reading these types of books. Paganism is the religion with homework as the phrase goes. My advice to you is to take breaks as needed for your mental health. Reading through relatively dense texts where you have to navigate a lot of the mentioned issues is draining. My second suggestion is for you to pirate electronic versions of a book you're interested in when it's related to paganism or witchcraft. Oftentimes, you will realize that nothing in a promising book is actually useful to you or it's the type of book that's an exercise in appropriation and incoherent rambling. And if you do like a book and find it useful you can always support the author by buying a copy after getting a feel for it in the pirated copy.</p>
